    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This authentic homemade pizza features a hand-stretched dough base topped
      with rich tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves.
      The pizza is adorned with tender mozzarella balls that melt beautifully
      during baking, creating pockets of gooey, stringy cheese throughout. Fresh
      cherry tomatoes add bursts of sweetness and acidity, perfectly balancing
      the richness of the cheese.

    <ul>
      <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup (240ml) warm water (110°F/43°C)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup (240ml) tomato sauce or pizza sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>8-10 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini)</li>
      <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Optional: garlic powder, red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a small bowl, combine warm water,
        sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. In a large
        bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Knead for
        8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Let the dough rise:</strong> Place the dough in a lightly oiled
        bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2
        hours until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
        If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up. Otherwise,
        prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Punch down the risen dough and
        transfer it to a floured surface. Roll or stretch it into a 12-inch
        circle, creating a slightly thicker edge for the crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the sauce and toppings:</strong> Spread tomato sauce evenly
        over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella
        cheese, then distribute the mozzarella balls and cherry tomato halves.
        Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter them on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season and drizzle:</strong> Sprinkle dried oregano, salt, and
        pepper over the pizza. Drizzle with olive oil for extra flavor and a
        golden finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the pizza:</strong> Transfer the pizza to the preheated
        oven (on the stone or baking sheet). Bake for 12-15 minutes until the
        crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the oven, let it cool for 2-3
        minutes, then slice and serve immediately. Add extra fresh basil if
        desired and enjoy your homemade pizza!
