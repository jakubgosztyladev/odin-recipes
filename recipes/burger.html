    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 blend)</li>
      <li>4 brioche burger buns with sesame seeds</li>
      <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>2 large tomatoes, sliced</li>
      <li>1 red onion, sliced into rings</li>
      <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter for cooking</li>
      <li>Optional: bacon strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Special Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pickle relish</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>French fries</li>
      <li>Fresh orange juice or your favorite beverage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the special sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix
        together mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, pickle relish, garlic powder, and
        paprika. Refrigerate until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form the patties:</strong> Divide the ground beef into 4 equal
        portions (about 4 oz each). Gently shape into patties slightly larger
        than your buns, as they'll shrink during cooking. Make a small
        indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent
        bulging. Season both sides generously with salt and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the patties:</strong> Heat a skillet or grill over
        medium-high heat. Add olive oil or butter. Cook the patties for 3-4
        minutes on the first side without moving them. Flip and cook for another
        3-4 minutes for medium doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the cheese:</strong> During the last minute of cooking,
        place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty. Cover the pan or close
        the grill lid to help the cheese melt perfectly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toast the buns:</strong> While the patties are resting, lightly
        toast the brioche buns on the grill or in a pan until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the burgers:</strong> Spread the special sauce on both
        halves of each bun. On the bottom bun, layer lettuce, tomato slices, the
        cheesy beef patty, pickles, and onion rings. Top with the upper bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Plate your burgers alongside crispy french fries
        and a glass of fresh orange juice. Serve immediately while hot and
        enjoy!
