    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the Salmon:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 salmon fillets (6 oz/170g each), skin-on</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fresh arugula or mixed greens</li>
      <li>Lemon wedges</li>
      <li>Fresh dill sprigs for garnish</li>
      <li>Edible flowers (optional)</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the marinade:</strong> In a small bowl, whisk together
        olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, chopped dill, parsley, oregano,
        salt, pepper, and paprika. Mix well to combine all the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinate the salmon:</strong> Pat the salmon fillets dry with
        paper towels. Place them in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over
        them, making sure each fillet is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for
        15-30 minutes. Don't marinate longer than 30 minutes as the acid from
        lemon can start to "cook" the fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat your cooking surface:</strong> Heat a grill pan or
        skillet over medium-high heat. Alternatively, preheat your outdoor grill
        to medium-high (about 400°F/200°C). Lightly oil the cooking surface to
        prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the salmon:</strong> Remove salmon from marinade and let
        excess drip off. Place fillets skin-side down on the hot grill or pan.
        Cook for 4-5 minutes without moving them, allowing a nice crust to form.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flip and finish cooking:</strong> Carefully flip the salmon
        fillets using a spatula. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until the salmon
        is cooked through but still slightly translucent in the center. The
        internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest the salmon:</strong> Remove the salmon from heat and let it
        rest for 2-3 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout
        the fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plate and serve:</strong> Arrange fresh arugula on serving
        plates. Place the salmon fillets on top. Garnish with fresh dill sprigs,
        lemon wedges, and edible flowers if using. Drizzle with a little extra
        virgin olive oil and serve immediately while hot.
